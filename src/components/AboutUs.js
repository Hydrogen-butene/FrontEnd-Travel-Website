      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        The early 1930s were a time of global instability. Britain’s influence
        was weakened because of a global financial depression, which reduced
        living standards, jobs, and trade. At the same time, extreme ideologies
        were gaining ground, with the rise of Communism in Russia, and Fascism
        in Germany, Italy and Spain. The UK government created the British
        Council in response. In our annual report for 1940-41, the aim was: ‘to
        create in a country overseas a basis of friendly knowledge and
        understanding of the people of this country, of their philosophy and way
        of life, which will lead to a sympathetic appreciation of British
        foreign policy, whatever for the moment that policy may be and from
        whatever political conviction it may spring.’
